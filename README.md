Background

What are we building:

* Library of attack paths/trees tailored to Cloud Services for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV) and mapped to specific damage scenarios.
* Attack paths consistent with inputs required for threat analysis and risk assessment process and in line with ISO/SAE Work Product (WP)-15-05
* Attack paths developed in machine-readable format for potential use in attack simulations; aligned with MITRE attack flow notation.
* Integration of attack path analysis into threat analysis and risk assessment package
* Attack paths developed based on (1) review of known exploits and (2) theoretical exploits

Attack flows will be bundled into various attack categories. Categories include: 

* Attacks Against Command and Control. For example, unauthorized access to vehicle control systems through cloud interfaces. 
* Attacks Against Software Updates
* Attacks Against Data Security
* Attacks Against Credential Management
* Attacks Against Service Availability
* Attacks Against Interface/API Security
* Attacks Against Cloud Infrastructure

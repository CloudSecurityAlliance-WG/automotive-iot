This section looks at historical attack paths examined from various public sources including the NVD Automotive Attack Database. From a protocol level, attacks have been seen from CAN to USB.

The above diagram uses data from NVD to show how previous attacks have worked.  The attack surface of connected vehicles with a growing software component has increased due to wireless connectivity to road masts, GPS, fobs, mobiles and diagnostic equipment. Data communications have been intercepted, spoofed and replayed to circumvent security. The most common route is to attack the telemetrics ECU to send malicious data packets along the CAN bus as this connects the safety features of a vehicle and some attacks via CAN have affected the braking ability of vehicles or remotely started them. Most attacks now require little if any physical access to the vehicle. Attacks where physical access can be obtained include via OBD ports (i.e. the diagnostics port used by mechanics) and via USB connectivity by car users who plug in mobile devices to infotainment systems.
Another area of attack has been the poor cryptography implemented by car manufacturers. Cryptologists have successfully obtained private keys through brute forcing, performed power analysis and other side channel techniques to obtain keys  from fobs and digital entry keys, discovered TLS missing from http connectivity from OBD Dongle to back-end servers.

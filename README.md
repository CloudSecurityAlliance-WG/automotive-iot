Background

* ISO/SAE 21434 requires threat analysis and risk assessment (TARA) process for vehicles/components
* TARA includes attack path analysis to identify paths an attacker may take to realize a threat scenario
* A tailorable vehicle-focused attack path library can be used by OEMs and Suppliers to quickly select and model attacks against threat scenarios

What are we building:

Library of attack paths/trees tailored to Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV) and mapped to specific damage scenarios.
Attack paths consistent with inputs required for threat analysis and risk assessment process and in line with ISO/SAE Work Product (WP)-15-05
Attack paths developed in machine-readable format for potential use in attack simulations; aligned with MITRE attack flow notation.
Integration of attack path analysis into threat analysis and risk assessment package
Attack paths developed based on (1) review of known exploits and (2) theoretical exploits
